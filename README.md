# iHub

><h3>The application that lets you submit orders to the Hub, ahead of time.</h3>

_<h4>Our web application uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery on the front-end, with PHP and a mySQL database hosted with MAMP for the back-end.</h4>_

Our (very early-stage) mockup of the front-end, from a user's perspective. Essential user stories and, consequently, development task items for our sprints derived from this first illustration.
